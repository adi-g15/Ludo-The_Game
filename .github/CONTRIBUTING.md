## Reporting bugs

In short,
    *Try the most recent `master` release
    * Search for existing issue
    * Include steps for reproduction

Also, if you can provide debug logging output, that will be great too.

## Requesting new features

Provide a clear and detailed explanation of the feature.

## Tests

Currently the repo doesn't have tests, but you may contribute tests too, need not be for whole codebase (which is rather big), but tests for basic functions are welcome too.

## Questions

If you have any questions, please feel free to open an issue, labeling it a question.
